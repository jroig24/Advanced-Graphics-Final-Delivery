### La Salle - Universitat Ramon Llull : Master in Advanced Videogame Development
## Advanced Graphics 1 - Final Delivery

In this project i've created some tools to control some variables in the demo.

# Rain particles
I've created some particles that simulates rain. These particles spawn transparent and get opaque over time, to avoid popping. 

# Color of the sun
There are 3 variables that correspond to the rgb values of the light of the scene. Changing this values will change the color of the main light instantly. This values can only be modified if the Day and night cycle is stopped.

# Day and night cycle
By default, opening the debug panels will trigger the day and night cycle. This can be modified with some values.
First of all there is the slider of the time. Changing it will make the time go faster or slower.

Next, there is the checkbox that controls the passing of time. Disabling it will prevent the in-engine time from going forward.

# Terrain specular
To resemble if the terrain is wet, I've created a slider to modify the specular of the terrain.

# Sea level
There are two buttons to get up or down the sea level.
